# EncryptionSystem
Encrypt Text with Random Unique Key

# to Run Program Encryption:
1.) Put Encryption.py in a folder alone.
2.) Run Encryption.py.
3.)Input Message to Encrypt.
4.)Copy The outputed list and store it in a python file named "letter.py" as variable "letter = [your copied encrypted letter]"
5.)Copy the Encryption Key Dictionary (e.g:key={'a':1,'b':2,...}) into a python file name "key.py" as variable "key = {your keyCode}"

# to Run Program Decryption
1.) Put key.py and letter.py in same folder as the Encryption.py(Main File)
2.) Run Encryption.py and it will display the Decrypted File.

# IMPORTANT! Once a File is Encrypted you can not generate the same key so don't lose the Encryption Code(e.g:key={'a':1,...})
Example letter.py and key.py In Repo.
